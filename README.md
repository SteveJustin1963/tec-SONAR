TEC-1 Sonar experiments

### www quotes;
- A sonar device sends out a sound wave, and then listens for the echo as the sound wave bounces off the bottom. By timing how long it takes for the echo to return, the sonar device can calculate the depth of the water. “sound navigation ranging”), technique for detecting and determining the distance and direction of underwater objects by acoustic means. Sound waves emitted by or reflected from the object are detected by sonar apparatus and analyzed for the information they contain.
- The range of frequencies used in sonar systems vary from infrasonic to ultrasonic. Sonar uses frequencies which are too much high-pitched (up to 120,000 cycles per second) for human ears to hear.
- Can submarines hear sonar? In short, yes. Sound propagates very well through the water compared to air. ASDIC was initially designed to work in a 14-22 KHz range, with 20 KHz being the high end of normal human hearing.
- How loud is sonar underwater? Sonar systems—first developed by the U.S. Navy to detect enemy submarines—generate slow-rolling sound waves topping out at around 235 decibels; the world's loudest rock bands top out at only 130.
- How far does sonar travel? According to experts, the sonar systems used by the navy generate sound waves that can reach 235 decibels. These sound waves can travel for hundreds of miles under water and can retain an intensity of 140 decibels as far as 300 miles from their source.
- Although these sonar devices were firstly used for underwater measurements, they have subsequently been used for in-air measurements (i.e., in-air sonar sensors). These sensors spread mechanical waves through the air and wait for the echoes.
- Why is sonar not used in air? Sonar jamming wouldn't be practical, because it would reveal your position and wouldn't mask your propulsion signature very well. The only way to mask your engine using audio countermeasures would be to generate a negative waveform of your signature and produce it in real time, which is very hard and also impractical.
- How do planes use sonar? In aircraft, active sonar is used in the form of disposable sonobuoys that are dropped in the aircraft's patrol area or in the vicinity of possible enemy sonar contacts. Passive sonar has several advantages, most importantly that it is silent.
